<p>***Not by magic - but by curiosity, patience and a crayon.***</p>
<p>In 1965, NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft transmitted the very first images of Mars from space. These were the first detailed images of another planet, taken up close. However, each photo was only 200 x 200 pixels - and transmitting a single image took about eight hours. The signal traveled 215 million kilometers through the Deep Space Network, which covers stations in South Africa, Australia, and California, before reaching the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California.</p>

<p>Each pixel arrived as a number from 0 (white) to 63 (black), printed by a teletype as endless strings of digits. The computers of the time were too slow to process this data quickly. And the engineers were impatient. They wanted to see Mars. Immediately.</p>
<p>And then they found an unconventional solution.</p>

<p>The prints with the numbers were cut into strips and arranged in the correct order on a wall - like a mosaic of numbers. One of the engineers, Richard Grumm, bought a set of pastel crayons, created a grayscale, and began manually coloring the numbers, transforming the raw data into a visual image. Each number became a shade - and gradually the surface of Mars emerged: rocky, lifeless, cratered.</p>

<p>This was not a photo or an infographic - but a digital image created by hand. And it was done faster than the technology of the time would have allowed.</p>

<p>"It was faster to draw by hand than to wait for the computer," recalls John Casani, the head of the Mariner 4 system.</p>

<p>It took 10 days to fully transmit all 22 images. But this very first version, created by truly human hands, has been preserved. Today, it is kept at JPL as a precious artifact - not only as a scientific document, but as a symbol of the union of science and art. It was exhibited at the laboratory museum, right next to where the Mariner 4 spacecraft itself was assembled.</p>
