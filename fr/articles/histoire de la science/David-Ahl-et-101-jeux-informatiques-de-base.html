<p>In 1973, the book "101 BASIC Computer Games" was published, quickly becoming a bestseller, with a million copies sold. It played a key role in popularizing programming, and behind its success was Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), a pioneer in mini-computer production.</p>
<p>A brief history of computer technology</p>
<p>In the late fifties of the last century, giant electronic tube machines, such as ENIAC and MARK-1, were largely replaced by a generation of transistor computers. Each subsequent generation was radically distinguished by its speed and the volume of data processed, but they still occupied a lot of space and required a team of professionals for their maintenance. The market at the time had several remarkable brands of computing machines that had a significant influence on the development of technologies and science. Here are some of them:</p>
<p>IBM 709 â€” one of the most popular machines of the time, used for scientific and military calculations.</p>
<p>UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I) â€” the first commercially successful computer, developed for use in businesses and government agencies.</p>
<p>PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1) â€” the first computer in the PDP range, developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which became the basis for the development of mini-computers. (more information on DEC will be written below)</p>
<p>EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) â€” one of the first practical stored-program computers, developed at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>CDC 1604 â€” a computer from Control Data Corporation, known for its high performance and its use in scientific research.</p>

<p>Programming in the 1970s-80s: The era of punch cards and patience<br>
The development process in the 1970s was nothing like today. Access to computing machines was limited, which influenced the entire process. Mainly, it involved the military, universities, and scientific institutions. Programming at that time was more of an art, requiring meticulousness, diligence, and immense patience. Working with code required attention, precision, and great perseverance. Developers wrote and modified code manually in notebooks or notepads. Imagine: no syntax highlighting, autocompletion, or debugger! If an error crept into the code or something needed to be changed, the code was rewritten or corrected with neat annotations. It was a long and monotonous process, requiring extreme concentration. There was no question of a mass programmer profession.</p>
<p>Program entry into the machine was an "art" in itself. The programmer or operator would sit in front of a punch card machine, place a notebook with the code next to them, and begin punching the code onto punch cards. A punch card machine is a device similar to a typewriter, where each key corresponded to a specific letter, number, or symbol. Pressing a key punched a hole in the correct column of the card. Each card represented one or more lines of code. Once the entry was complete, the cards were sent for verification. The operator would re-enter the data into the verification device, and the machine would compare it with the punched holes. A punch card with an error was either replaced or corrected by punching new holes in the appropriate columns. When all the cards were ready, they were arranged in a strict order. The order was of paramount importance, as it was in this sequence that the cards were read by the machine. Then, the cards were transferred to the reader. Even relatively small programs required hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of punch cards for encoding. Any error, whether a poorly punched hole or a violation of the sequence, resulted in a program crash. And then, the whole process had to start over.</p>

<p>DEC and David Ahl<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) graduates Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson were no strangers to computing. Working at Lincoln Laboratory (a research and development center of the US Department of Defense within MIT), they carried out most of the development projects for the AN/FSQ-7, TX-0, and TX-2 machines. The TX-0 was the first fully transistorized 16-bit computer with 16-bit addressing and 16-bit instructions.</p>

The name "AN/FSQ" comes from Army-Navy / Fixed Special eQuipment.</p>
<p>The AN/FSQ-7 was the largest discrete computer system ever built. It was the primary computer system for the SAGE network, designed and built by IBM. It was enormous, containing approximately 49,000 vacuum tubes, weighing hundreds of tons, and consuming megawatts of power. The punch card program from the previous photo ran on this system

<p>In 1957, Kenneth Olsen and Harlan Anderson founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) with the goal of making computing machines cheaper and smaller. The company's initial capital was $100,000, 70% of which belonged to American Research and Development. The American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC) was a pioneering venture capital firm, and its investment in DEC is considered the first success story in venture capital history. A classic example of a startup from those years ðŸ˜Š. The founding company insisted that the subsidiary's name not include the word "computer," although the original name was "Digital Computer Corporation." This condition was also respected in product names: instead of the term "computer," the term "Programmable Data Processor," or "PDP" for short, was used. This condition was due to the stereotype at the time that a computer was something enormous and expensive, requiring a separate machine room and a strong maintenance staff. In this way, the company avoided the negative consequences of this stereotype.</p>

<p>In 1969, DEC invited David Ahl to work as an educational psychology and marketing consultant to develop its line of educational products. Ahl had a strong background in science and business: he held degrees in electrical engineering and business administration. Before joining DEC, he had experience in education and was known for his interest in using computers in the learning process. He began his career at Digital Equipment Corporation as an educational psychology and marketing consultant to develop a range of computers that did not require special training to maintain computer systems. David Ahl edited DEC's newsletter, which regularly published code blocks and programming instructions for mini-computers. Ahl persuaded management to publish a collection of games in BASIC.
- BASIC, the language in which the games were written, was gaining popularity at the time.
- BASIC was designed for students to easily write programs using time-sharing terminals. It was intended for "simpler" users, less interested in program execution speed than in the simple ability to use a computer to solve their problems, without special training.
- The language interpreter was present in all PDP models, except the earliest ones (PDP-1, PDP-4, PDP-5).</p>

<p>The collection cost $7.50 plus 50 cents for shipping. Today, that price is equivalent to approximately $50.25, considering an average annual inflation of 3.8%.</p>
<p>Programming enthusiasts from across the country played a significant role in the book's creation. DEC announced a contest, inviting programmers to submit their BASIC games. Authors of the best works received compensation, and their games were included in the collection. This crowdsourcing approach made the book truly unique. It became not only a collection of games, but also a reflection of the enthusiasm and creativity of an entire generation of amateur programmers. DEC had fairly strict requirements for the submission format, which was necessary to standardize and simplify the publishing process. Here are some of these requirements:
Paper. White, unlined. As few creases as possible on prints.
Printing. Fresh black ribbon. Red was not accepted.
Punch tape. A folded punch tape coated with paraffin was preferred (paper impregnated with paraffin for strength and protection with holes for the tape drive mechanism). If an impregnated tape was used (e.g., from a teletype), it had to be carefully folded (folds every 8.5 inches (21.59 cm)), leaving at least 17 inches (43.18 cm) of blank beginning and 8.5 inches (21.59 cm) of blank end. The impregnated tape had to be wrapped in plastic film or waxed paper to prevent contamination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start â€” the beginning of the tape that remains blank before data recording begins.</li>
<li>End â€” the end of the tape that remains blank after data recording ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, authors had to provide the following information:
* Name
* Full address
* Phone
* School (if applicable)
* Age
* Computer system used
* Program source (original idea or adaptation)</p>
<p>By submitting a program, the author gave Digital Equipment Corp. the right to publish, reprint, distribute, or otherwise use it. Authorship, of course, was always indicated.</p>

<p>In addition to this book, two additional guides were published:
Understanding Mathematics and Logic using BASIC Computer Games for 7th to 12th Graders.
Starting Computer Science in the Classroom for 2nd to 7th Graders.</p>
<p>The book had three reissues:
1st edition: July 1973.
2nd edition: April 1974.
3rd edition: March 1975.</p>
<p>In 1973, David Ahl was laid off from his position due to downsizing, but even before his layoff, he was accepted into a new division of DEC. This group worked on creating a computer smaller than any ever built, with the intention of launching a new product into new markets, such as schools. They succeeded in building a compact machine combining a PDP-8 with a VT50 terminal, and they were also able to integrate a PDP-11 into a small portable case. When the result was presented to DEC's operating committee, the engineers liked it, but the sales department feared it would reduce sales of their existing lines. Finally, the decision was made by Ken Olsen, one of the founders of Digital Equipment Corporation, who ultimately stated: "I see no reason why anyone would want their own computer."</p>
<p>At this point, the project ended.</p>
<p>In 1974, Ahl left DEC, disillusioned by company politics, and founded Creative Computing, one of the first magazines to popularize computers. Over the next decade, Creative Computing covered the entire spectrum of amateur, home, and personal computers, and although Ahl sold the magazine in the early 1980s, he continued to be its editor-in-chief.
In June 2022, Ahl put everything he had ever written, from prose to software, into the public domain.</p>

<p>In this collection
I start porting games to Python. Each game comes with source code, a detailed explanation, a flowchart, and an algorithm so you can easily understand how it works and start experimenting.</p>
<p>My opinion</p>
<p>Learning to code by writing games gives the student the opportunity to see a meaningful result of code execution. In the repository, the code is written as simply as possible to be accessible to beginners. During the process, I will provide recommendations for writing code, comments, and adhering to PEP-8 style.</p>
