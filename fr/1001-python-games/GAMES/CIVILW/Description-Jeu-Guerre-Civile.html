<p>CIVILW :
=================
Difficulty: 7
-----------------
The game "Civil War" is a battle simulation between two armies: the Confederacy and the Union. The player controls the Confederacy and makes decisions regarding the size of their troops and the type of attacks (direct attack or flanking maneuver). The goal of the game is to defeat the Union army, while minimizing their own losses. The game takes into account random factors that influence the outcome of the battle, making each battle unique.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The player controls the Confederate army and must defeat the Union army.
2. The player enters the number of soldiers they wish to send to attack.
3. The player chooses the type of attack: direct (1) or flanking (2).
4. Depending on the player's choice and random factors, losses are calculated for both sides.
5. After each battle, the game displays the current strengths of both armies.
6. The game ends with the victory of one side when the opposing army's strength becomes equal to or less than 0.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Set the initial strengths of the Union army (UnionForce) to 1000 and the Confederate army (ConfederateForce) to 800.
2. Start a loop "as long as both armies have strengths greater than 0":
    2.1. Ask the player for the number of soldiers they wish to send to attack (AttackForce).
        2.1.1. If AttackForce is greater than the available Confederate forces (ConfederateForce), display the message "Insufficient forces" and return to the beginning of step 2.1.
    2.2. Ask the player for the type of attack: direct (1) or flanking (2) (AttackType).
    2.3. Calculate Confederate losses (ConfederateLosses) randomly, by multiplying AttackForce by a random number from 0 to 0.4 (for a direct attack) or by a random number from 0 to 0.2 (for a flanking maneuver).
        2.3.1. If ConfederateLosses is greater than AttackForce, set ConfederateLosses equal to AttackForce.
    2.4. Calculate Union losses (UnionLosses) randomly, by multiplying AttackForce by a random number from 0 to 0.3.
        2.4.1. If AttackType is equal to 2, increase UnionLosses by a random number from 0 to 100.
    2.5. Update army strengths:
        ConfederateForce = ConfederateForce - ConfederateLosses
        UnionForce = UnionForce - UnionLosses
    2.6. Display the current strengths of both armies.
    2.7. Check victory condition:
        2.7.1. If UnionForce is less than or equal to 0, display the message "The Confederacy wins!" and end the game.
        2.7.2. If ConfederateForce is less than or equal to 0, display the message "The Union wins!" and end the game.
3. End of game.

<p>Legend:
    Start - Program start.
    InitializeForces - Initialization of initial strengths of Union troops (unionForce = 1000) and Confederate (confederateForce = 800).
    LoopStart - Start of the loop, which continues as long as both armies have strengths greater than 0.
    InputAttackForce - Prompts the player for the number of soldiers for the attack (attackForce).
    CheckForce - Checks if the Confederacy has enough forces for the attack (attackForce > confederateForce).
    OutputInsufficient - Displays the message "Insufficient forces", if the attack forces are greater than the available forces.
    InputAttackType - Prompts the player to choose the type of attack: direct (1) or flanking (2).
    CalculateConfederateLosses - Calculation of Confederate losses (confederateLosses) based on attackForce and attack type, taking into account a random factor. If losses exceed attackForce, losses are set equal to attackForce.
    CalculateUnionLosses - Calculation of Union losses (unionLosses) based on attackForce and attack type, taking into account a random factor. For a flanking attack, Union losses are increased by a random number.
    UpdateForces - Update of the strengths of both armies after the battle.
    OutputForces - Display of the current strengths of the Confederate and Union armies.
    CheckUnionWin - Checks if the Confederacy has won (Union army strength <= 0).
    OutputConfederateWin - Displays the Confederacy's win message.
    CheckConfederateWin - Checks if the Union has won (Confederate army strength <= 0).
    OutputUnionWin - Displays the Union's win message.
    End - Program end.</p>
