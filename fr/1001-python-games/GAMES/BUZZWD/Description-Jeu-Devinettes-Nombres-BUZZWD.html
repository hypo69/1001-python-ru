<p>BUZZWD :
=================
Difficulty: 4
-----------------
The game "BUZZWD" is a simple number game where the computer generates a random number, and the player must guess it by entering numbers in turn. After each entry, the program indicates whether the entered number is "too high", "too low" or if it has been guessed. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The computer selects a random integer from 1 to 100.
2. The player enters their guesses for the hidden number.
3. After each attempt, the computer indicates whether the entered number was too low, too high, or guessed.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the hidden number.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Set the attempts counter to 0.
2. Generate a random number in the range of 1 to 100.
3. Start a loop "as long as the number is not guessed":
    3.1 Increase the attempts counter by 1.
    3.2 Ask the player to enter a number.
    3.3 If the entered number is equal to the hidden number, display "GUESSED" and go to step 4.
    3.4 If the entered number is less than the hidden number, display "TOO LOW".
    3.5 If the entered number is greater than the hidden number, display "TOO HIGH".
4. Display "ATTEMPTS {attempts counter}"
5. End of game.

<p>Legend:
    Start - Program start.
    InitializeVariables - Initialization of variables: numberOfGuesses (number of attempts) is set to 0, and targetNumber (hidden number) is randomly generated from 1 to 100.
    LoopStart - Start of the loop, which continues as long as the number is not guessed.
    IncreaseGuesses - Incrementing the attempts counter by 1.
    InputGuess - Prompts the user to enter a number and saves it to the userGuess variable.
    CheckGuess - Checks if the entered number userGuess is equal to the hidden number targetNumber.
    OutputWin - Displays the message "GUESSED" if the numbers are equal.
    OutputAttempts - Displays the message "ATTEMPTS {numberOfGuesses}", indicating the number of attempts.
    End - Program end.
    CheckLow - Checks if the entered number userGuess is less than the hidden number targetNumber.
    OutputLow - Displays the message "TOO LOW" if the entered number is less than the hidden number.
    OutputHigh - Displays the message "TOO HIGH" if the entered number is greater than the hidden number.</p>
