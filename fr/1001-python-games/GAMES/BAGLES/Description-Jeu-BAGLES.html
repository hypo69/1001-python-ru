<p>BAGLES :
=================
Difficulty: 6
-----------------
The game "Bagels" is a logic and puzzle game in which the player tries to guess a three-digit number composed of unique digits. After each attempt, the player receives clues: "PICO" means that one of the digits is guessed and is in the correct position, "FERMI" means that one of the digits is guessed but not in the correct position, "BAGELS" means that none of the digits are guessed.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The computer generates a random three-digit number composed of unique digits.
2. The player enters their guesses as a three-digit number.
3. The computer provides clues:
    - "PICO" - a digit is guessed and is in the correct position.
    - "FERMI" - a digit is guessed but not in the correct position.
    - "BAGELS" - none of the digits are guessed.
4. Clues are given in the order of the digits of the hidden number, for example if the hidden number is <code>123</code> and the player entered <code>142</code>, the clues will be <code>PICO FERMI</code>.
5. The game continues until the player guesses the number.
6. If after 10 attempts the player does not guess the number, the game ends and the hidden number is displayed.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Generate a random three-digit number composed of unique digits (e.g., 123).
2. Set the number of attempts to 0.
3. Loop "as long as the number is not guessed or the number of attempts is less than 10":
    3.1. Increase the number of attempts by 1.
    3.2. Ask the player for a three-digit number.
    3.3. Compare the entered number with the hidden number and generate the clues "PICO", "FERMI", and "BAGELS".
    3.4. If the number is guessed, display a win message and the number of attempts.
    3.5. If the number is not guessed, display the generated clues.
4. If after 10 attempts the number is not guessed, display the hidden number and a defeat message.
5. End of game.

    Start - Game start.
    GenerateSecretNumber - Generation of the secret number secretNumber from 3 unique digits and initialization of the number of attempts numberOfGuesses = 0.
    LoopStart - Start of the loop, which continues as long as the number is not guessed and the number of attempts is less than 10.
    IncreaseGuesses - Incrementing the attempts counter by 1.
    InputGuess - Prompts the user to enter a number and saves it to the userGuess variable.
    GenerateClues - Generation of clues based on the comparison of userGuess and secretNumber.
    CheckWin - Checking if the entered number userGuess is equal to the secret number secretNumber.
    OutputWin - Displaying the win message and the number of attempts.
    End - Game end.
    OutputClues - Displaying the generated clues.
    CheckLose - Checking if the number of attempts has reached 10.
