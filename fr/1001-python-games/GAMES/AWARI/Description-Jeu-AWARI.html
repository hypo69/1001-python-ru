<p>AWARI :
=================
Difficulty: 6
-----------------
The game "Awari" is a board game simulating the traditional Mancala game, where two players take turns moving "stones" (in this case, numbers) from the board's cells, trying to capture as many stones as possible in their "stores". This is a simplified version of the game where the player plays against the computer.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The game board consists of 14 cells, numbered 0 to 13. Cells 6 and 13 are the players' "stores".
2. At the start of the game, each of the 12 cells (0-5 and 7-12) contains 4 stones.
3. The player (human) starts the game.
4. Selects a cell with their stones (0-5).
5. All stones from the selected cell are moved one by one into each subsequent cell clockwise, including their own "store".
6. If the last stone lands in the player's store, the player has the right to make another move.
7. If the last stone lands in an empty cell on the player's side, and there are stones opposite that cell, the player takes the stones from that cell and the opposite cell into their store.
8. The computer plays in the same way.
9. The game ends when all cells with stones become empty.
10. The player with the most stones in their store wins.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Initialize the board (array) of 14 cells with 4 stones in each, except cells 6 and 13, which are 0.
2. Start a loop "as long as the game is not over"
3. Player's turn:
    3.1 Ask the player to enter the cell number (0 to 5).
    3.2 Move the stones from the selected cell clockwise.
    3.3 Check if the last stone landed in the player's store (cell 6). If yes, give the player another turn.
    3.4 Check if the last stone landed in an empty cell on the player's side. If yes, capture the stones from that cell and the opposite cell.
4. Computer's turn (similar to the player's turn, but cell selection is random from 7 to 12).
5. If all cells with stones are empty, end the game.
6. Display the result (number of stones in the player's and computer's stores).
7. Determine the winner (who has the most stones in their store).

<p>Legend:
   Start - Program start.
    InitializeBoard - Initialize the game board with 14 cells. The first 6 (0-5) and the last 6 (7-12) represent cells with stones, 6 and 13 are the players' stores.
    GameLoopStart - Start of the game loop, which continues until the game is over.
    PlayerTurnStart - Start of the player's turn.
    PlayerInputCell - Ask the player for the number of the cell from which to move the stones.
    PlayerMoveStones - Move the stones from the selected cell clockwise.
    PlayerCheckExtraTurn - Check if the last stone landed in the player's store. If yes, the player gets an extra turn.
    PlayerCheckCapture - Check if the last stone landed in an empty cell on the player's side.
    PlayerCaptureStones - Capture the stones from the opposite cell if the last stone landed in an empty cell on the player's side.
    ComputerTurnStart - Start of the computer's turn.
    ComputerSelectCell - The computer selects a random cell for its move.
    ComputerMoveStones - The computer moves the stones clockwise.
    ComputerCheckExtraTurn - Check if the last stone landed in the computer's store. If yes, the computer gets an extra turn.
    ComputerCheckCapture - Check if the last stone landed in an empty cell on the computer's side. If yes, the computer captures the stones from the opposite cell.
    ComputerCaptureStones - Capture the stones from the opposite cell if the last stone landed in an empty cell on the computer's side.
    EndGame - End of the game.
    OutputResult - Display the results and determine the winner.
    End - End of the program.</p>
