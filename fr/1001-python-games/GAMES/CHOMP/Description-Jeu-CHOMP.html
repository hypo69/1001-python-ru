Difficulty: 5
-----------------
The game "CHOMP" is a two-player game played on a rectangular board, representing a chocolate bar.
One of the corners (usually bottom left) represents a poisoned "square". Players take turns breaking off pieces of the bar, by making moves. The goal of the game is to force the opponent to eat the poisoned square.
The player who is forced to eat the poisoned square loses.
Game rules:
1. The game board is a rectangular chocolate bar.
2. One of the corners (bottom left) is considered poisoned.
3. Players take turns biting off a piece of the chocolate bar.
4. The player chooses a row and a column (bites a piece of chocolate).
5. All cells to the right and above the selected position are removed.
6. The goal is to force the opponent to eat the poisoned square.

Algorithm:
1. Start of the game.

3. Initialize the game board, representing the chocolate bar.
4. Start the game loop, as long as the game is not over:
    4.1. Display the current state of the board on the screen.
    4.2. Ask the current player for the coordinates of the piece of chocolate to bite.
    4.3. Update the state of the board after biting the selected piece.
    4.4. Check if the current player has eaten the poisoned square.
    4.5. If yes, declare the opponent's victory and end the game.
