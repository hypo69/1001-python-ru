<h3><strong>Polynomial Time</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Polynomial time</strong> is a term used in computational complexity theory to describe the execution time of an algorithm that grows as a polynomial of the input size. If the execution time of an algorithm can be expressed as \(O(n^k)\), where \(n\) is the input size and \(k\) is a constant, then such an algorithm runs in polynomial time.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sorting a list</strong>: Algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort run in \(O(n \log n)\), which is polynomial time.</li>
<li><strong>Finding the shortest path in a graph</strong>: Dijkstra's algorithm runs in \(O(n^2)\) or \(O(n \log n)\) depending on the implementation, which is also polynomial.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Characteristics:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms running in polynomial time are considered <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>practically applicable</strong>.</li>
<li>Problems that can be solved in polynomial time belong to class <strong>P</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Exponential Time</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Exponential time</strong> is the execution time of an algorithm that grows exponentially with the input size. If the execution time can be expressed as \(O(k^n)\), where \(n\) is the input size and \(k\) is a constant, then such an algorithm runs in exponential time.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traveling Salesperson Problem</strong>: Solving by exhaustive enumeration of all possible routes requires \(O(n!)\) time, which is worse than exponential.</li>
<li><strong>Enumerating all subsets</strong>: An algorithm that checks all possible subsets of a set of \(n\) elements runs in \(O(2^n)\).</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Characteristics:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms running in exponential time are considered <strong>inefficient</strong> for large inputs, because the execution time becomes too large even for relatively small \(n\).</li>
<li>Problems that can only be solved in exponential time often belong to <strong>NP-hard</strong> or <strong>NP-complete</strong> classes.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Polynomial time</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms running in polynomial time are considered <strong>practically applicable</strong>, because they can process large volumes of data within a reasonable time.</li>
<li>Problems in class <strong>P</strong> (solvable in polynomial time) form the basis of many applications in computer science, such as data processing, networks, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exponential time</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms running in exponential time become <strong>impractical</strong> even for relatively small inputs. For example, for \(n = 100\), \(2^n\) already exceeds the number of atoms in the observable Universe.</li>
<li>Problems that can only be solved in exponential time often require the use of <strong>approximate methods</strong>, <strong>heuristics</strong>, or <strong>parallel computing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Example for understanding</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine you have a problem, and you want to solve it for \(n = 10\) and \(n = 100\):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polynomial time (\(n^2\))</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For \(n = 10\): \(10^2 = 100\) operations.</li>
<li>For \(n = 100\): \(100^2 = 10\,000\) operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exponential time (\(2^n\))</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For \(n = 10\): \(2^{10} = 1,024\) operations.</li>
<li>For \(n = 100\): \(2^{100} \approx 1.26 \times 10^{30}\) operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As can be seen, for \(n = 100\), a polynomial algorithm will perform 10,000 operations, which is quite feasible, while an exponential algorithm will require \(1.26 \times 10^{30}\) operations, which is practically impossible.</p>
<p>To plot graphs illustrating the difference between polynomial and exponential time, various mathematical functions can be used. Here are examples of functions that can be used for visualization:</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Polynomial functions</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Linear function</strong>:
\( f(n) = n \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm that processes each element once.</li>
<li><strong>Quadratic function</strong>:
\( f(n) = n^2 \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm with nested loops, such as bubble sort.</li>
<li><strong>Cubic function</strong>:
\( f(n) = n^3 \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm that processes three-dimensional data.</li>
<li><strong>Logarithmic function</strong>:
\( f(n) = \log n \)
Example: execution time of binary search.</li>
<li><strong>Linear-logarithmic function</strong>:
\( f(n) = n \log n \)
Example: execution time of quicksort or merge sort.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Exponential functions</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exponential function</strong>:
\( f(n) = 2^n \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm that enumerates all subsets of a set.</li>
<li><strong>Factorial function</strong>:
\( f(n) = n! \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm that enumerates all permutations (e.g., the traveling salesperson problem).</li>
<li><strong>Exponential function with a different base</strong>:
\( f(n) = 3^n \)
Example: execution time of an algorithm that explores all possible combinations.</li>

<h3><strong>What will the graph show?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polynomial functions</strong> grow slowly and remain at the bottom of the graph.</li>
<li><strong>Exponential functions</strong> grow very rapidly and skyrocket even for small values of \(n\).</li>
<li>Using a <strong>logarithmic scale</strong> (on the Y-axis) helps visualize the difference between polynomial and exponential functions, as their values differ by several orders of magnitude.</li>
