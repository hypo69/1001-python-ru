How to connect and use Magenta's Melody RNN model, based on Python and TensorFlow.

Python version 3.7

**1. Installing Magenta:**

First, you need to install the Magenta library. The recommended installation method is via pip.

*   **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```
*   **Install Magenta:**
    ```bash
    pip install magenta
    ```
    *   **Note:** Magenta may require TensorFlow. If you don't have it, pip will install it automatically.
    *   **For GPU acceleration:** If you have an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA, you can install the TensorFlow version with GPU support (see TensorFlow documentation).

**2. Importing necessary modules:**

After installing Magenta, import the necessary modules into your Python script:
```python
import os
import magenta.music as mm
from magenta.models.melody_rnn import melody_rnn_sequence_generator
from magenta.common import sequence_example_lib
```

**3. Loading a trained model:**

Melody RNN models are trained on large datasets and are available for download. You can choose one of the pre-trained models (e.g., `attention_rnn` or `basic_rnn`).

*   **Model initialization:**
    ```python
    model_name = 'attention_rnn'  # Or 'basic_rnn'
    melody_rnn = melody_rnn_sequence_generator.MelodyRnnSequenceGenerator(
        model_name=model_name
    )
    ```
    *   Upon initialization, the model will automatically load the necessary weights.

**4. Generating a melody:**

Now you can generate a melody. To do this, use the `generate()` method:
```python
# Generation parameters
temperature = 1.0  # Controls randomness, 1.0 is a normal value
num_steps = 128   # Number of steps (length) of the melody
primer_sequence = None # You can set a primer melody, leaving None, the model will start from scratch.
# Creating a melody
melody_sequence = melody_rnn.generate(
    temperature=temperature,
    steps=num_steps,
    primer_sequence=primer_sequence
)
```
*   `temperature`: The higher the value, the more random and "creative" the generation will be, but it may also become less coherent.
*   `steps`: Sets the number of steps in the generated melody.
*  `primer_sequence`: Sets the melody from which the model starts generating. If `None`, the model will start from scratch.

**5. Working with MIDI:**

The generated melody is represented as a `Sequence` object, which can be saved to a MIDI file or used for further processing:
```python
# Saving to MIDI
output_dir = 'generated_music'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
midi_file = os.path.join(output_dir, 'generated_melody.mid')
mm.sequence_proto_to_midi_file(melody_sequence, midi_file)

print(f"Melody saved to: {midi_file}")
```

**6. Adding chords and drums (as in the example):**

You can combine the generated melody with chord progressions and drum parts, as shown in your example code:
```python
# Chords
chords = ["C", "G", "Am", "F"] * (num_steps // 4) # Creating a chord sequence by repetition
chord_sequence = mm.ChordSequence(chords)
melody_with_chords_sequence = mm.sequences_lib.concatenate_sequences(melody_sequence, chord_sequence)

# Drums
drum_pattern = mm.DrumTrack(
    [36, 0, 42, 0, 36, 0, 42, 0],
    start_step=0,
    steps_per_bar=num_steps//4,
    steps_per_quarter=4,
)

music_sequence = mm.sequences_lib.concatenate_sequences(melody_with_chords_sequence, drum_pattern)
music_sequence.tempos[0].qpm = 120  # Setting the tempo

# Saving the full track to MIDI
midi_file_with_chords_and_drums = os.path.join(output_dir, 'full_music.mid')
mm.sequence_proto_to_midi_file(music_sequence, midi_file_with_chords_and_drums)

print(f"Full music saved to: {midi_file_with_chords_and_drums}")
```

**Full example:**

```python
import os
import magenta.music as mm
from magenta.models.melody_rnn import melody_rnn_sequence_generator

# 1. Setting parameters
output_dir = 'generated_music'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

model_name = 'attention_rnn'
melody_rnn = melody_rnn_sequence_generator.MelodyRnnSequenceGenerator(
    model_name=model_name
)

temperature = 1.0
num_steps = 128
primer_sequence = None
# 2. Generating a melody
melody_sequence = melody_rnn.generate(
    temperature=temperature,
    steps=num_steps,
    primer_sequence=primer_sequence
)

# 3. Adding chords
chords = ["C", "G", "Am", "F"] * (num_steps // 4)
chord_sequence = mm.ChordSequence(chords)
melody_with_chords_sequence = mm.sequences_lib.concatenate_sequences(melody_sequence, chord_sequence)


# 4. Adding drums
drum_pattern = mm.DrumTrack(
    [36, 0, 42, 0, 36, 0, 42, 0],
    start_step=0,
    steps_per_bar=num_steps // 4,
    steps_per_quarter=4,
)
music_sequence = mm.sequences_lib.concatenate_sequences(melody_with_chords_sequence, drum_pattern)
music_sequence.tempos[0].qpm = 120


# 5. Saving to MIDI
midi_file_with_chords_and_drums = os.path.join(output_dir, 'full_music.mid')
mm.sequence_proto_to_midi_file(music_sequence, midi_file_with_chords_and_drums)

print(f"Full music saved to: {midi_file_with_chords_and_drums}")

```

**Additional tips:**

*   **Experiment with parameters:** Try different values for `temperature`, `num_steps`.
*   **Load your own MIDI:** You can use your own melodies as a primer (`primer_sequence`).
*   **Train a model on your own data:** If you want a specific style, try training a model on your own dataset.
*   **Explore Magenta documentation:** Magenta provides good documentation and examples.
*  **Note:** `primer_sequence` should be in the form of `mm.NoteSequence()`.
