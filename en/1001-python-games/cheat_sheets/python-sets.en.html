<h1>Sets in Python</h1>
<p><strong>1. Introduction: What are sets?</strong></p>
<p>In computer science and mathematics, sets are a way to represent collections of unique elements. It is important to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Each element in a set must be unique. Duplicates are not allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Unordered:</strong> The order of elements in a set does not matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Sets and fruits</strong></p>
<p>We will imagine that we only have the fruits themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>🍎 (apple)</li>
<li>🍐 (pear)</li>
<li>🍉 (melon)</li>
<li>🧺 (basket)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are <em>no</em> identical fruits in the set:</strong> If there is an apple in the set, there will not be another identical apple. Each fruit is unique in its set.</li>
<li><strong>The order of fruits does not matter:</strong> If there is an apple and a pear in the set, it is the same as if there were a pear and an apple. The order does not matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, <code>{🍎, 🍐, 🍉}</code> is a set containing an apple, a pear, and a melon.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do sets require unique elements?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sets are designed to track the <em>presence</em> of elements, not their <em>quantity</em>.</li>
<li>The uniqueness of elements simplifies performing operations on sets.</li>
<li>Sets are used to eliminate data redundancy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Set operations (fruit sets):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Union: "Gather all fruits into one set"</strong>
    *   Combine two sets of fruits, gathering all fruits into a new set. If there are identical fruits in both sets, the new set will only have one such fruit.
    *   If set A has {🍎, 🍐}, and set B has {🍐, 🍉}, then set A ∪ B will be {🍎, 🍐, 🍉}.</li>
<li><strong>Intersection: "Find common fruits"</strong>
    *   Find <em>only</em> those fruits that are in both set A and set B.
    *   If set A has {🍎, 🍐}, and set B has {🍐, 🍉}, then set A ∩ B will only be {🍐}.</li>
<li><strong>Difference: "Fruits that are in one set but not in another"</strong>
    *   Find <em>only</em> those fruits that are in set A, but not in set B.
    *   If set A has {🍎, 🍐}, and set B has {🍐, 🍉}, then set A - B will be {🍎}, and set B - A will be {🍉}.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Difference: "Fruits that are only in one of the sets"</strong>
    *   Find <em>all</em> fruits that are either in set A or in set B, but not in both simultaneously.
    *   If set A has {🍎, 🍐}, and set B has {🍐, 🍉}, then set A ^ B will be {🍎, 🍉}.</li>
<li><strong>Subset: "Are all fruits from one set in another?"</strong>
    *   Check if set A is a subset of set B. This means that all fruits from set A are also in set B.
    *   <strong>Example:</strong> If set A has {🍎, 🍐}, and set B has {🍎, 🍐, 🍉}, then A <= B.</li>
<li><strong>Superset: "Does one set contain all fruits from another?"</strong>
    *   Check if set A is a superset of set B. This means that all fruits from set B are also in set A.
    *   If set A has {🍎, 🍐, 🍉}, and set B has {🍎, 🍐}, then A >= B.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>create_fruit_set(fruit_string)</code>:</strong> This function creates a set from a string of fruits.
    *   <code>set(fruit_string)</code> converts the string to a set, removing duplicates and making the order of elements irrelevant.
    *   We check that the string consists only of allowed Unicode characters.</li>
<li><strong><code>display_set(fruit_set)</code>:</strong> This function is used to convert a set to a readable string for output.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> We create several sets and apply various operations to them. The results of each operation are printed to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Practice tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your own fruit sets and try all operations on them.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>is_disjoint(set1, set2)</code> function, which will check if two sets are disjoint (intersection = empty set).</li>
<li>Implement the <code>power_set(fruit_set)</code> function, which will return the set of all subsets of a given set.</li>
<li>Try to apply sets to solve a real problem. For example, you have two lists of guests for a party, find guests who are in both lists, guests who are only in the first list, etc.</li>
