<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
<p>In everyday life and in programming, we face the need to order data.
This can be anything: a shopping list, books on a shelf, or search results.
Sorting algorithms are a set of instructions that help us arrange elements in a specific order, whether ascending,
descending, or according to some other criterion.</p>
<p>For example, I use fruits of different sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Representation of fruits with sizes:</strong></p>
<p>Let's map fruits to sizes. We will use tuples, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first element is the size of the fruit:
    *   🍎 (small) – apple
    *   🍐 (medium) – pear
    *   🍉 (large) – melon
    *   🧺 (very large) – basket</li>
<li>The second element is a unique identifier, for program operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <code>(🍎, 1)</code> – is a small apple with identifier 1.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">from typing import List, Tuple

def compare_fruits(fruit1: Tuple[str, int], fruit2: Tuple[str, int]) -> int:
    """
    Compares two fruits by size.

    Args:
        fruit1: Tuple (size, identifier).
        fruit2: Tuple (size, identifier).

    Returns:
        -1 if fruit1 is less than fruit2, 1 if fruit1 is greater than fruit2, 0 if equal.
    """
    order = {"🍎": 0, "🍐": 1, "🍉": 2, "🧺": 3}  # Define the order of fruits by size
    size1 = order.get(fruit1[0]) # Get the size of the first fruit
    size2 = order.get(fruit2[0]) # Get the size of the second fruit
    if size1 < size2: # If the size of the first fruit is smaller, return -1
        return -1
    elif size1 > size2: # If the size of the first fruit is larger, return 1
        return 1
    else: # If sizes are equal, return 0
      return 0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sorting algorithms (comparison by fruit size):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> (Lighter bubbles float up earlier)
    *   The algorithm compares adjacent fruits by size. If a fruit is larger than its neighbor, it swaps places with it.
    *   This process is repeated until the entire list of fruits is sorted from smallest to largest.
    *   Analogy: Imagine you have an aquarium with air bubbles of different sizes. Lighter bubbles (corresponding to smaller fruits) will float to the surface earlier than heavier ones (corresponding to larger fruits). Thus, lighter fruits "float" to the top of the list, and heavier ones sink to the bottom.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Insertion Sort:</strong>
    *   The algorithm builds a sorted list by adding fruits one by one. A new fruit is inserted into the correct position to maintain the size order.
    *   Insertion sort is good for small lists or those where the data is already almost sorted.</li>
<li><strong>Selection Sort:</strong>

<p><strong>Code explanation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>compare_fruits(fruit1, fruit2)</code>:</strong> This function compares two fruits by size and returns -1 if the first fruit is smaller, 1 if larger, and 0 if they are equal. I use the <code>order</code> dictionary to define the order of fruit sizes.</li>
<li><strong><code>bubble_sort(fruits)</code>:</strong> I implement the bubble sort algorithm, where adjacent fruits are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.</li>
<li><strong><code>insertion_sort(fruits)</code>:</strong> I implement the insertion sort algorithm, where each new fruit is inserted into the correct position in the already sorted part of the list.</li>
<li><strong><code>selection_sort(fruits)</code>:</strong> I implement the selection sort algorithm, where in each pass I find the smallest fruit and place it in the correct position.</li>
<li><strong><code>display_fruits(fruits)</code>:</strong> This function converts a list of fruits into a string for convenient output.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> At the end, I create a list of fruits and apply all three sorting algorithms to it, printing the results of each. I also show you the order in which the fruits are sorted.</li>
