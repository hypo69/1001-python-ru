        "\n",
        "Google Colab is a cloud-based platform, created by Google, for working with interactive Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
        "It provides powerful tools for writing and executing Python code, analyzing data, training machine learning models, and collaborating on projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Colab provides access to powerful computing resources, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs).\n",
        "This allows you to solve complex problems, such as processing large data or training neural networks, without the need to purchase expensive equipment. Colab is built on Jupyter Notebook, providing a convenient interface for working with code, text, and visualizations. You can execute code cells, insert explanatory text, create graphs and visualizations directly in your browser. You can use Colab immediately after opening. There is no need to install additional programs, libraries, or drivers. Everything is already configured for work. You can connect your Google Drive, which allows you to easily upload data, save projects, and access files from anywhere. Colab supports collaboration. You can share your projects with colleagues, edit notebooks simultaneously, and discuss changes in real time.\n",

        "\n",
        "# How does Google Colab work?  \n",
        "- You run a Jupyter notebook in your browser, which eliminates the need to install a local environment.  \n",
        "- The code is executed on remote Google servers, and the results are displayed in your notebook.  \n",
        "- Data can be loaded from a local device or from the cloud, such as Google Drive.  \n",
        "- You can use Colab for writing Python code, working with machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), analyzing data using Pandas, or creating visualizations through Matplotlib and Seaborn.  \n",
