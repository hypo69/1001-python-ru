Difficulty: 5
-----------------
The game "CHOMP" is a two-player game played on a rectangular board representing a chocolate bar.
One of the corners (usually the bottom left) represents a poisonous "square". Players take turns breaking off pieces from the bar, making moves. The goal of the game is to force the opponent to eat the poisoned square.
The player who is forced to eat the poisoned square loses.
Game rules:
1. The game board is a rectangular chocolate bar.
2. One of the corners (bottom left) is considered poisoned.
3. Players take turns biting off a piece of the chocolate bar.
4. The player selects a row and column (bites off a piece of chocolate).
5. All cells to the right and above the selected position are removed.
6. The goal is to force the opponent to eat the poisoned square.
7. The player who eats the poisoned square loses.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1.  Game start.
2.  Prompt the user for the size of the chocolate bar (number of rows and columns).
3.  Initialize the game board, representing the chocolate bar.
4.  Start the game loop, until the game ends:
    4.1.  Display the current state of the board on the screen.
    4.2.  Prompt the current player for the coordinates of the piece of chocolate to bite off.
    4.3.  Update the board state by biting off the selected piece.
    4.4.  Check if the current player has eaten the poisoned square.
    4.5.  If so, declare the opposite player as the winner and end the game.
    4.6.  Pass the turn to the next player.
5. End of game.
