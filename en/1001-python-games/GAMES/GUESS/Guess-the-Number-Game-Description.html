<p>GUESS:
=================
Difficulty: 3
-----------------
The game "Guess the Number" is a classic game in which the computer selects a random number in the range of 1 to 100, and the player must guess this number, receiving hints "too low" or "too high" after each attempt.
The game continues until the player guesses the number.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The computer selects a random integer from 1 to 100.
2. The player enters their guesses for the hidden number.
3. After each attempt, the computer reports whether the entered number was too low, too high, or guessed.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the hidden number.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Set the number of attempts to 0.
2. Generate a random number in the range of 1 to 100.
3. Start a loop "while number is not guessed":
    3.1 Increment the number of attempts by 1.
    3.2 Prompt the player to enter a number.
    3.3 If the entered number is equal to the hidden number, go to step 4.
    3.4 If the entered number is less than the hidden number, display "TOO LOW".
    3.5 If the entered number is greater than the hidden number, display "TOO HIGH".
4. Display "YOU GOT IT IN {number of attempts} GUESSES!"
5. End of game.

<p>Legend:
    Start - Program start.
    InitializeVariables - Initialize variables: numberOfGuesses (number of attempts) is set to 0, and targetNumber (hidden number) is randomly generated from 1 to 100.
    LoopStart - Start of the loop, which continues until the number is guessed.
    IncreaseGuesses - Increment the number of attempts by 1.
    InputGuess - Prompt the user to enter a number and save it to the userGuess variable.
    CheckGuess - Check if the entered number userGuess is equal to the hidden number targetNumber.
    OutputWin - Display "YOU GOT IT IN {numberOfGuesses} GUESSES!" message if numbers are equal, indicating the number of attempts.
    End - End of program.
    CheckLow - Check if the entered number userGuess is less than the hidden number targetNumber.
    OutputLow - Display "TOO LOW" message if the entered number is less than the hidden number.
    OutputHigh - Display "TOO HIGH" message if the entered number is greater than the hidden number.</p>
