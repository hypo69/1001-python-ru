<p>FIPOWR:
=================
Difficulty: 6
-----------------
The game "Fibonacci Power" is a mathematical game where the computer chooses a random number in the range of 1 to 100, and the player enters a number.
The computer raises the randomly chosen number to the power of the Fibonacci number corresponding to the attempt number, and compares it with the user's number.
The game continues until the numbers are equal.</p>
<p>Game rules:
1. The computer chooses a random integer from 1 to 100.
2. The player enters their number.
3. The computer calculates the Fibonacci number corresponding to the attempt number, and raises the random number to that power.
4. Compares the obtained result with the player's number.
5. The game continues until the numbers are equal.
-----------------
Algorithm:
1. Set the attempt counter to 0.
2. Generate a random number in the range of 1 to 100.
3. Start a loop "while player's number is not equal to the number raised to the Fibonacci power":
    3.1. Increment the attempt counter by 1.
    3.2. Calculate the Fibonacci number corresponding to the attempt number.
    3.3. Raise the random number to the power of the Fibonacci number.
    3.4. Prompt the player for a number.
    3.5. If the player's number is equal to the calculated number, go to step 4.
    3.6. If the player's number is not equal to the calculated number, display a message about the current state.
4. Display message "YOU GOT IT IN {number of attempts} GUESSES!"
5. End of game.

<p>Legend:
    Start - Program start.
    InitializeVariables - Initialize variables: numberOfGuesses (number of attempts) is set to 0, and targetNumber (hidden number) is randomly generated from 1 to 100.
    LoopStart - Start of the loop, which continues until the number is guessed.
    IncreaseGuesses - Increment the attempt counter by 1.
    CalculateFibonacci - Calculate the Fibonacci number corresponding to the current attempt.
    CalculatePower - Raise the hidden number to the power of the Fibonacci number.
    InputGuess - Prompt the user for a number and save it to the userGuess variable.
    CheckGuess - Check if the entered number userGuess is equal to the calculated number poweredNumber.
    OutputWin - Display a win message if the numbers are equal, indicating the number of attempts.
    End - End of program.
    OutputTryAgain - Display "Try Again!" message if the entered number is not equal to the calculated number.</p>

Explanation of the code:
1.  **Import `random` module**:
   -  `import random`: Imports the `random` module, which is used for generating a random number.
2.  **`fibonacci(n)` function**:
    -   Defines the `fibonacci(n)` function, which calculates the n-th Fibonacci number.
    -   Uses an iterative approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
3.  **Variable initialization**:
    -   `numberOfGuesses = 0`: Initializes the `numberOfGuesses` variable to count the player's attempts.
    -   `targetNumber = random.randint(1, 100)`: Generates a random integer in the range of 1 to 100 and saves it to `targetNumber`.
4. **Main loop `while True:`**:
    - An infinite loop that continues until the player guesses the number (`break` command will be executed).
    - `numberOfGuesses += 1`: Increments the attempt counter by 1 on each new loop iteration.
    - `fibonacciNumber = fibonacci(numberOfGuesses)`: Calls the `fibonacci` function to get the Fibonacci number corresponding to the current attempt.
    - `poweredNumber = targetNumber ** fibonacciNumber`: Calculates the hidden number raised to the power of the Fibonacci number.
    - **Input**:
       - `try...except ValueError`: The try-except block handles possible input errors. If the user enters a non-integer, an error message will be displayed.
       - `userGuess = int(input(f"Attempt {numberOfGuesses}: Enter a number: "))`: Prompts the user for a number and converts it to an integer, saving the result to `userGuess`.
    - **Win condition**:
      -  `if userGuess == poweredNumber:`: Checks if the entered number is equal to the calculated value.
      -  `print(f"CONGRATULATIONS! You guessed the number in {numberOfGuesses} attempts!")`: Displays a win message and the number of attempts.
      - `break`: Ends the loop (and the game) if the number is guessed.
    -  **Hint**:
       - `else:`: If the number is not guessed, the message "Try again!" is displayed.
