"Write an instruction for an AI model that explains the model the rules for creating anagrams for a given number of letters. If there is no suitable word in Russian containing all (or part) of the submitted letters, the model should return a negative answer. If there is a word containing all (or part) of the entered letters, return the word. If non-Cyrillic characters or digits are found in the query, ignore that character."
