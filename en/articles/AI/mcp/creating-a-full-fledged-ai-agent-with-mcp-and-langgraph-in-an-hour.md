# How to teach a neural network to work with its hands: creating a full-fledged AI agent with MCP and LangGraph in an hour

Friends, greetings! I hope you've missed me.

Over the past couple of months, I've been deeply immersed in researching the integration of AI agents into my own Python projects. In the process, I've accumulated a lot of practical knowledge and observations that it would be a sin not to share. So today I'm returning to Habr — with a new topic, a fresh perspective, and the intention to write more often.

On the agenda are LangGraph and MCP: tools with which you can create truly useful AI agents.

If before we argued about which neural network answers better in Russian, today the battlefield has shifted towards more applied tasks: who copes better with the role of an AI agent? Which frameworks truly simplify development? And how to integrate all this good stuff into a real project?

But before diving into practice and code, let's clarify the basic concepts. Especially two key ones: **AI agents and MCP**. Without them, the conversation about LangGraph will be incomplete.

### AI agents in simple terms

AI agents are not just "pumped-up" chatbots. They represent more complex, autonomous entities that possess two crucial features:

1.  **Ability to interact and coordinate**

    Modern agents can break down tasks into subtasks, call other agents, request external data, work in a team. This is no longer a solitary assistant, but a distributed system where each component can contribute.

2.  **Access to external resources**

    An AI agent is no longer limited by the boundaries of a dialogue. It can access databases, make API calls, interact with local files, vector knowledge bases, and even run commands in the terminal. All this became possible thanks to the emergence of MCP — a new level of integration between the model and the environment.

---

Simply put: **MCP is a bridge between a neural network and its environment**. It allows the model to "understand" the context of the task, access data, make calls, and form reasoned actions, rather than just outputting text responses.

**Let's imagine an analogy:**

*   You have a **neural network** — it can reason and generate texts.
*   There are **data and tools** — documents, APIs, knowledge bases, terminal, code.
*   And there is **MCP** — it's an interface that allows the model to interact with these external sources as if they were part of its internal world.

**Without MCP:**

Model — is an isolated dialogue engine. You feed it text — it responds. And that's it.

**With MCP:**

Model becomes a full-fledged **task executor**:

*   gains access to data structures and APIs;
*   calls external functions;
*   navigates the current state of the project or application;
*   can remember, track, and change context as the dialogue progresses;
*   uses extensions such as search tools, code runners, vector embedding databases, etc.

In a technical sense, **MCP is a protocol for interaction between an LLM and its environment**, where context is provided as structured objects (instead of "raw" text), and calls are formatted as interactive operations (e.g., function calling, tool usage, or agent actions). This is what turns an ordinary model into a **true AI agent**, capable of doing more than just "talking."

### And now — to business!

Now that we've covered the basic concepts, it's logical to ask: "How do we implement all this in practice in Python?"

This is where **LangGraph** comes into play — a powerful framework for building state graphs, agent behaviors, and thought chains. It allows you to "stitch together" the logic of interaction between agents, tools, and the user, creating a living AI architecture that adapts to tasks.

In the following sections, we'll look at how to:

*   build an agent from scratch;
*   create states, transitions, and events;
*   integrate functions and tools;
*   and how this entire ecosystem works in a real project.

### A little theory: what is LangGraph

Before we dive into practice, a few words about the framework itself.

**LangGraph** is a project from the **LangChain** team, the very ones who first proposed the concept of "chains" for interacting with LLMs. If before the main focus was on linear or conditionally branching pipelines (langchain.chains), now the developers are betting on a **graph model**, and LangGraph is what they recommend as the new "core" for building complex AI systems.

**LangGraph** is a framework for building finite state machines and state graphs, where each **node** represents a part of the agent's logic: a model call, an external tool, a condition, user input, etc.

### How it works: graphs and nodes

Conceptually, LangGraph is built on the following ideas:

*   **Graph** — is a structure that describes the possible execution paths of logic. You can think of it as a map: from one point you can move to another depending on conditions or the result of execution.
*   **Nodes** — are specific steps within the graph. Each node performs some function: calls a model, calls an external API, checks a condition, or simply updates the internal state.
*   **Transitions between nodes** — is the routing logic: if the result of the previous step is such and such, then go there.
*   **State** — is passed between nodes and accumulates everything needed: history, intermediate conclusions, user input, tool operation results, etc.

Thus, we get a **flexible mechanism for controlling agent logic**, in which both simple and very complex scenarios can be described: loops, conditions, parallel actions, nested calls, and much more.

### Why is it convenient?

LangGraph allows you to build **transparent, reproducible, and extensible logic**:

*   easy to debug;
*   easy to visualize;
*   easy to scale for new tasks;
*   easy to integrate external tools and MCP protocols.

In essence, LangGraph is the **"brain" of the agent**, where each step is documented, controllable, and can be changed without chaos and "magic."

### And now — enough theory!

We could talk for a long time about graphs, states, logic composition, and the advantages of LangGraph over classic pipelines. But, as practice shows, it's better to see it in code once.

**Time to move on to practice.** Next — a Python example: we'll create a simple but useful AI agent based on LangGraph that will use external tools, memory, and make its own decisions.

### Preparation: cloud and local neural networks

To start creating AI agents, we first need a **brain** — a language model. There are two approaches here:

*   **use cloud solutions**, where everything is ready "out of the box";
*   or **raise the model locally** — for complete autonomy and confidentiality.

Let's consider both options.

#### Cloud services: fast and convenient

The easiest way is to use the power of large providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, and use...

### Where to get keys and tokens:

*   **OpenAI** — ChatGPT and other products;
*   **Anthropic** — Claude;
*   **OpenRouter.ai** — dozens of models (one token — many models via OpenAI-compatible API);
*   **Amvera Cloud** — ability to connect LLAMA with ruble payment and built-in proxying to OpenAI and Anthropic.

This path is convenient, especially if you:

*   don't want to configure infrastructure;
*   develop with a focus on speed;
*   work with limited resources.

### Local models: full control

If **privacy, offline work** are important to you, or you want to build **fully autonomous agents**, then it makes sense to deploy the neural network locally.

**Main advantages:**

*   **Confidentiality** — data remains with you;
*   **Offline work** — useful in isolated networks;
*   **No subscriptions and tokens** — free after setup.

**Disadvantages are obvious:**

*   Resource requirements (especially for video memory);
*   Setup can take time;
*   Some models are difficult to deploy without experience.

Nevertheless, there are tools that make local launch easier. One of the best today is **Ollama**.

### Deploying a local LLM via Ollama + Docker

We will prepare a local launch of the Qwen 2.5 model (qwen2.5:32b) using a Docker container and the Ollama system. This will allow integrating the neural network with MCP and using it in your own agents based on LangGraph.

If the computing resources of your computer or server are insufficient to work with this version of the model, you can always choose a less "resource-hungry" neural network — the installation and launch process will remain similar.

**Quick installation (summary of steps)**

1.  **Install Docker + Docker Compose**
2.  **Create project structure:**
```bash
mkdir qwen-local && cd qwen-local
```
3.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`**
(universal option, GPU detected automatically)

```yaml
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    container_name: ollama_qwen
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./ollama_data:/root/.ollama
      - /tmp:/tmp
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*
    restart: unless-stopped
```

4.  **Start container:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5.  **Download model:**
```bash
docker exec -it ollama_qwen ollama pull qwen2.5:32b
```

6.  **Check API operation:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen2.5:32b", "prompt": "Hello!", "stream": false}'
```
*(Image with command execution result)*

7.  **Integration with Python:**
```python
import requests

def query(prompt):
    res = requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/generate", json={
        "model": "qwen2.5:32b",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False
    })
    return res.json()['response']

print(query("Explain quantum entanglement"))
```
Now you have a full-fledged local LLM, ready to work with MCP and LangGraph.

**What's next?**

We have a choice between cloud and local models, and we've learned how to connect both. The most interesting part is ahead — **creating AI agents on LangGraph**, which use the selected model, memory, tools, and their own logic.

### Simple launch of LLM agents via LangGraph: basic integration

Let's start with the simplest: how to "connect the brain" to the future agent. We will analyze the basic ways to launch language models (LLMs) using LangChain, so that in the next step we can move on to integration with LangGraph and building a full-fledged AI agent.

#### Imports
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
from langchain_deepseek import ChatDeepSeek
```
*   `os` and `load_dotenv()` — for loading variables from the `.env` file.
*   `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatOllama`, `ChatDeepSeek` — wrappers for connecting language models via LangChain.

> 💡 If you use alternative approaches to working with configurations (e.g., Pydantic Settings), you can replace `load_dotenv()` with your usual method.

#### Loading environment variables
```python
load_dotenv()
```
This will load all variables from `.env`, including keys for accessing the OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter APIs, and others.

#### Simple functions for getting LLM

**OpenAI**
```python
def get_openai_llm():
    return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```
If the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable is correctly set, LangChain will substitute it automatically — explicit `api_key=...` here is optional.

**DeepSeek**
```python
def get_deepseek_llm():
    # ...
```
Similarly, but we use the `ChatDeepSeek` wrapper.

**OpenRouter (and other compatible APIs)**
```python
def get_openrouter_llm(model="moonshotai/kimi-k2:free"):
    return ChatOpenAI(
        model=model,
        api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"),
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        temperature=0
    )
```
**Features:**

*   `ChatOpenAI` is used, even though the model is not from OpenAI — because OpenRouter uses the same protocol.
*   `base_url` is required: it points to the OpenRouter API.
*   The `moonshotai/kimi-k2:free` model was chosen as one of the most balanced options in terms of quality and speed at the time of writing.
*   The `OpenRouter` API key must be passed explicitly — automatic substitution does not work here.

#### Mini-test: checking model operation
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llm = get_openrouter_llm(model="moonshotai/kimi-k2:free")
    response = llm.invoke("Who are you?")
    print(response.content)
```
*(Image with execution result: `I am an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI...`)*

If everything is configured correctly, you will receive a meaningful response from the model. Congratulations — the first step is done!

### But this is not yet an agent

At the current stage, we have connected LLM and made a simple call. This is more like a console chatbot than an AI agent.

**Why?**

*   We write **synchronous, linear code** without state logic or goals.
*   The agent does not make decisions, does not remember context, and does not use tools.
*   MCP and LangGraph are not yet involved.

**What's next?**

Next, we will implement a **full-fledged AI agent** using **LangGraph** — first without MCP, to focus on the architecture, states, and logic of the agent itself.

Let's dive into real agent mechanics. Let's go!

### Job classification agent: from theory to practice

...concepts of LangGraph in practice and create a useful tool for HR platforms and freelance exchanges.

#### Agent task

Our agent takes a text description of a vacancy or service as input and performs a three-level classification:

1.  **Job type**: project work or permanent vacancy
2.  **Profession category**: from 45+ predefined specialties
3.  **Search type**: whether a person is looking for a job or looking for a performer

The result is returned in a structured JSON format with a confidence score for each classification.

#### 📈 Agent architecture on LangGraph

Following the principles of LangGraph, we create a **state graph** of four nodes:

- Input description
- ↓
- Job type classification node
- ↓
- Category classification node
- ↓
- Search type determination node
- ↓
- Confidence calculation node
- ↓
- JSON result

Each node is a **specialized function** that:

*   Receives the current state of the agent
*   Performs its part of the analysis
*   Updates the state and passes it on

#### State management

Define the **agent's memory structure** via `TypedDict`:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Dict

class State(TypedDict):
    """Agent state for storing information about the classification process"""
    description: str
    job_type: str
    category: str
    search_type: str
    confidence_scores: Dict[str, float]
    processed: bool
```

This is the **agent's working memory** — everything it remembers and accumulates during analysis. Similar to how a human expert keeps the task context in mind when analyzing a document.

Let's look at the full code, and then focus on the main points.

```python
import asyncio
import json
from enum import Enum
from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any, List

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

        self.workflow = self._create_workflow()

    def _create_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
        """Creates the agent's workflow based on LangGraph"""
        workflow = StateGraph(State)
        
        # Add nodes to the graph
        workflow.add_node("job_type_classification", self._classify_job_type)
        workflow.add_node("category_classification", self._classify_category)

        print("-" * 80)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```
*(...the rest of the code with method implementation was presented in the article...)*

### Key advantages of the architecture
1.  **Modularity** — each node solves one task, easy to test and improve separately
2.  **Extensibility** — new analysis nodes can be added without changing existing ones
3.  **Transparency** — the entire decision-making process is documented and traceable
4.  **Performance** — asynchronous processing of multiple requests
5.  **Reliability** — fallback mechanisms and error handling

### Real benefits
Such an agent can be used in:
*   **HR platforms** for automatic categorization of resumes and vacancies
*   **Freelance exchanges** for improving search and recommendations
*   **Internal systems** of companies for processing applications and projects
*   **Analytical solutions** for labor market research

### MCP in action: creating an agent with a file system and web search
After we have understood the basic principles of LangGraph and created a simple classifier agent, let's expand its capabilities by connecting it to the outside world via MCP.

Now we will create a full-fledged AI assistant that can:
*   Work with the file system (read, create, modify files)
*   Search for relevant information on the Internet
*   Remember the context of the dialogue
*   Handle errors and recover from failures

#### From theory to real tools
Remember how at the beginning of the article we talked about **MCP being a bridge between a neural network and its environment**? Now you will see this in practice. Our agent will gain access to **real tools**:
```
# File system tools
- read_file — read files
- write_file — write and create files
- list_directory — view folder contents
- create_directory — create folders

# Web search tools
- brave_web_search — search the Internet
- get_web_content — get page content
```
This is no longer a "toy" agent — it is a **working tool** that can solve real problems.

#### 📈 Architecture: from simple to complex

**1. Configuration as the basis of stability**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class AgentConfig:
    """Simplified AI agent configuration"""
    filesystem_path: str = "/path/to/work/directory"
    model_provider: ModelProvider = ModelProvider.OLLAMA
    use_memory: bool = True
    enable_web_search: bool = True

    def validate(self) -> None:
        """Configuration validation"""
        if not os.path.exists(self.filesystem_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Path does not exist: {self.filesystem_path}")
```
**Why is this important?** Unlike the classification example, here the agent interacts with external systems. One error in the file path or a missing API key — and the entire agent stops working. **Validation at startup** saves hours of debugging.

**2. Model factory: flexible choice**
```python
def create_model(config: AgentConfig):
    """Creates a model according to the configuration"""
    provider = config.model_provider.value
    if provider == "ollama":
        return ChatOllama(model="qwen2.5:32b", base_url="http://localhost:11434")
    elif provider == "openai":
        return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    # ... other providers
```
One code — many models. Want a free local model? Use Ollama. Need maximum accuracy? Switch to GPT-4. Speed is important? Try DeepSeek. The code remains the same.

**3. MCP integration: connecting to the real world**
```python
async def _init_mcp_client(self):
    """MCP client initialization"""
    mcp_config = {
        "filesystem": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", self.filesystem_path],
            "transport": "stdio"
        },
        "brave-search": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search@latest"],
            "transport": "stdio",
            "env": {"BRAVE_API_KEY": os.getenv("BRAVE_API_KEY")}
        }
    }
    self.mcp_client = MultiServerMCPClient(mcp_config)
    self.tools = await self.mcp_client.get_tools()
```
Here, the key MCP work happens: we connect external MCP servers to the agent, which provide a set of tools and functions. The agent then receives not just individual functions, but a full contextual understanding of how to work with the file system and the Internet.

#### Error resilience
In the real world, everything breaks: the network is unavailable, files are blocked, API keys are expired. Our agent is ready for this:
```python
@retry_on_failure(max_retries=2, delay=1.0)
async def process_message(self, user_input: str, thread_id: str = "default") -> str:
    # ...
```
The `@retry_on_failure` decorator automatically retries operations on temporary failures. The user won't even notice that something went wrong.

### Results: from theory to practice of AI agents

Today we have gone from basic concepts to creating working AI agents. Let's summarize what we have learned and achieved.

**What we have mastered**

**1. Fundamental concepts**
*   Understood the difference between chatbots and true AI agents
*   Understood the role of **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** as a bridge between the model and the outside world
*   Studied the architecture of **LangGraph** for building complex agent logic

**2. Practical skills**
*   Configured a working environment with support for cloud and local models
*   Created a **classifier agent** with asynchronous architecture and state management
*   Built an **MCP agent** with access to the file system and web search

**3. Architectural patterns**
*   Mastered modular configuration and model factories
*   Implemented error handling and **retry mechanisms** for production-ready solutions

### Key advantages of the approach
**LangGraph + MCP** give us:
*   **Transparency** — every agent step is documented and traceable
*   **Extensibility** — new features are added declaratively
*   **Reliability** — built-in error handling and recovery
*   **Flexibility** — support for multiple models and providers out of the box

### Conclusion

AI agents are not futuristic fiction, but **real technology of today**. With LangGraph and MCP, we can create systems that solve specific business problems, automate routines, and open up new possibilities.

**The main thing is to start.** Take the code from the examples, adapt it to your tasks, experiment. Each project is a new experience and a step towards mastery in the field of AI development.

Good luck with your projects!
