***Not by magic - but by curiosity, patience, and a pencil.***</p>
<p>    In 1965, NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft transmitted the first-ever images of Mars from space. These were the first detailed close-up images of another planet. However, each photo consisted of only 200 by 200 pixels - and transmitting a single image took about eight hours. The signal traveled 215 million kilometers through the Deep Space Network, spanning stations in South Africa, Australia, and California, before reaching the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California.</p>

<p>    Each pixel arrived as a number from 0 (white) to 63 (black), printed out by a teletype as endless strings of digits. The computers of that time were too slow to process this data quickly. And the engineers were impatient. They wanted to see Mars. Immediately.</p>
<p>And then they found an unconventional solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/hypo69/1001-python-ru/blob/master/assets/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%20%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%20%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%E2%81%A0%E2%81%A0/photo_2025-08-17_22-44-14.jpg" alt="4"></p>
<p>    The printouts with the numbers were cut into strips and arranged in the correct sequence on a wall - like a mosaic of numbers. One of the engineers, Richard Grumm, bought a set of pastel pencils, created a grayscale chart, and began to manually color in the numbers, turning the dry data into a visual image. Each number became a shade - and gradually the surface of Mars emerged: rocky, lifeless, pockmarked with craters.</p>

<p>    It wasn't a photo or computer graphics - but a digital image created by hand. And it was done faster than the technology of the time would have allowed.</p>

<p>"It was faster to draw by hand than to wait for the computer," recalled John Casani, the head of the Mariner 4 system.</p>

<p>    It took 10 days to fully transmit all 22 images. But that very first version, created by truly human hands, has been preserved. Today it is stored at JPL as a precious artifact - not just as a scientific document, but as a symbol of the union of science and art. It was put on display in the laboratory's museum, right next to the place where the Mariner 4 spacecraft itself was once assembled.</p>
