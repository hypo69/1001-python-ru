<h3>How to automatically update programs using Ninite and Windows Task Scheduler</h3>
<p>Keeping software up to date is key to the security and stability of your system. However, manually checking and installing updates for each application can be time-consuming. In this article, we will look at how to automate this process using the Ninite.com service and the built-in Windows Task Scheduler.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Getting started with Ninite and creating an installer</h3>
<p>Ninite is a service designed for simultaneous installation and updating of several popular applications. It aims to save you time by eliminating the need to manually install each program, scroll through installation wizards, and reject offers to install toolbars or other unwanted software.</p>
<p><strong>Key features and benefits of Ninite:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Download the installer:</strong> After selecting the applications, click the <strong>"Get Your Ninite"</strong> button. The site will generate and offer you to download a personal executable file. This small file is your universal installer/updater.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Setting up automatic updates</h3>
<p>Now that you have a configured Ninite installer, let's figure out where best to place it and how to set up automatic launch.</p>
<p><strong>Where to place the Ninite file</strong></p>
<p>For the system to be able to find and run your Ninite file without problems, it is recommended to create a separate folder for it. This will prevent accidental deletion or movement of the file.</p>
<p><strong>Placement recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid system folders:</strong> Do not save the file in the root of the <code>C:</code> drive or in the <code>C:\Windows</code> folder.</li>
<li><strong>Create a dedicated folder:</strong> A good practice would be to create a folder, for example, <code>C:\NiniteUpdater</code>. This will simplify file management and future searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Move the Ninite file downloaded from the site (e.g., <code>Ninite-software-bundle.exe</code>) to the folder you created earlier (<code>C:\NiniteUpdater</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Setting up automatic launch via Windows Task Scheduler</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that programs are checked and updated automatically every Sunday, we will use the built-in Windows tool — <strong>Task Scheduler</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Opening Task Scheduler:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press <code>Win + R</code>, type <code>taskschd.msc</code>, and press Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Creating a new task:</strong></p>
<p>In the Task Scheduler window, in the right-hand "Actions" pane, select <strong>"Create Basic Task..."</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name and description:</strong> Enter a clear name for your task, for example, "Weekly Ninite Update". Click "Next".</li>
<li><strong>Trigger (launch time):</strong> In this step, you need to specify how often the task will run.
<ul>
<li>Select "Weekly" and click "Next".</li>
<li>Specify the day of the week — "Sunday". You can also choose a convenient launch time, for example, when the computer is usually on but not actively used. Click "Next".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Here we will specify which program to run.
<ul>
<li>Select "Start a program" and click "Next".</li>
<li>In the "Program or script" field, click the "Browse..." button and find your Ninite file in the folder you created earlier (<code>C:\NiniteUpdater\Ninite-software-bundle.exe</code>).</li>
<li>Click "Next".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Completion:</strong> In the last step, check all the specified parameters. If everything is correct, click "Finish".</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, Task Scheduler will automatically run your Ninite file every Sunday at the time you specified. When Ninite runs in the background, it will check the versions of your selected programs and, if it finds updates, it will download and install them without your intervention. Thus, you get a simple and reliable system for keeping your software up to date.</p>
