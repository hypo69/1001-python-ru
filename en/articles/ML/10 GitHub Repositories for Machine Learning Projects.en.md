### 10 GitHub Repositories for Machine Learning Projects

**Explore these top machine learning repositories to develop your skills, build your portfolio, and unleash your creativity with hands-on projects, real-world challenges, and AI resources.**

**Author: Abid Ali Awan, Assistant Editor at KDnuggets, July 21, 2025 in "Machine Learning"**

Machine learning is a vast and dynamic field that encompasses a wide range of areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, core machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning, and much more. While courses can help you learn the theoretical foundations, they often don't provide the practical experience needed to solve real-world problems or demonstrate your capabilities to potential employers.

To become a job-ready machine learning engineer, it's important to build a diverse portfolio of projects that showcases both your technical skills and practical experience.

In this article, we'll explore 10 GitHub repositories that contain collections of machine learning projects. Each repository includes code examples, tutorials, and guides to help you learn by doing and expand your portfolio with effective, real-world projects.
