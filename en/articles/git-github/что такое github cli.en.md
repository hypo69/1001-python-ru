# GitHub CLI

## What is GitHub CLI?

**GitHub CLI** (short for `gh`) is a command-line tool that allows you to work with GitHub directly from your terminal.
With it, you can manage repositories, issues, pull requests, releases, and other entities without going to the GitHub web interface.

CLI is convenient for developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone who automates work with GitHub or prefers the terminal over a browser.

## Installation

GitHub CLI is supported on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

* **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

* **macOS (via Homebrew):**

```bash

```

* **Windows (via Winget):**

```

After installation, check the version:

## Authorization

To access private repositories and actions, you need to authorize:

```bash
