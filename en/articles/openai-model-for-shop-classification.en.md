# Training an OpenAI model to classify web pages

## Introduction

Training an OpenAI model to determine if a page is an online store.

- data preparation,
- text tokenization,
- sending data for training
- model testing.

## Step 1: Registration and setup of the OpenAI API

To get started with the OpenAI API, you need to register on the OpenAI platform and get an API key. This key will be used for authentication when calling API methods.

```python
import openai

# Set the API key
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
```

## Step 2: Data preparation

To train the model, you need to prepare a dataset that will contain examples of web pages,
both stores and non-stores.
Each entry should include the page text and the corresponding label (`positive` for stores and `negative` for non-stores).

Example JSON file:

```json
[
    {
        "text": "<html><body><h1>Welcome to Our Online Store</h1><p>We offer a wide range of products at competitive prices. Visit our store today!</p></body></html>",
        "label": "positive"
    },
    {
        "text": "<html><body><h1>About Us</h1><p>We are a leading provider of quality services. Contact us for more information.</p></body></html>",
        "label": "negative"
    }
]
```

## Step 3: Text tokenization

Before sending the data to the OpenAI model, the text must be tokenized.
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
In Python, you can use libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or tokenizers from the transformers library.

Example of tokenization using NLTK:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Example text
text = "This is an example text for tokenization."

# Tokenize the text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tokenized_text = ' '.join(tokens)
print(tokenized_text)
```

## Step 4: Sending data for training

After tokenizing the text, you can send the data to train the OpenAI model.
Here is an example of code for sending data:

```python
import openai

def train_model(data, positive=True):
    try:
        response = openai.Train.create(
            model="text-davinci-003",
            documents=[entry["text"] for entry in data],
            labels=["positive" if positive else "negative"] * len(data),
            show_progress=True
        )
        return response.id
    except Exception as ex:
        print("An error occurred during training:", ex)
        return None

# Example of use
data = [
    {"text": "Text of the first web page...", "label": "positive"},
    {"text": "Text of the second web page...", "label": "negative"}
]

job_id = train_model(data, positive=True)
print("Job ID:", job_id)
```

## Step 5: Testing the model

After training the model, you need to test it on a test dataset.
Here is an example of code for testing:

```python
def test_model(test_data):
    try:
        predictions = []
        for entry in test_data:
            response = openai.Completion.create(
                model="text-davinci-003",
                prompt=entry["text"],
                max_tokens=1
            )
            prediction = response.choices[0].text.strip()
            predictions.append(prediction)
        return predictions
    except Exception as ex:
        print("An error occurred during testing:", ex)
        return None

# Example of use
test_data = [
    {"text": "Text of a test web page...", "label": "positive"},
    {"text": "Text of another test page...", "label": "negative"}
]

predictions = test_model(test_data)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

## Step 6: Error handling and model improvement

If the model makes incorrect predictions, you can improve it
by adding more data or changing the training parameters. You can also use feedback to analyze errors.

Example of error handling:

```python
def handle_errors(predictions, test_data):
    for pred, entry in zip(predictions, test_data):
        if pred != entry["label"]:
            print(f"Incorrect prediction for page '{entry['name']}': Predicted {pred}, Actual {entry['label']}")

# Example of use
handle_errors(predictions, test_data)
```
